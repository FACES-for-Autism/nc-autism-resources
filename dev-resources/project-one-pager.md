# FACES repository discovery web page

> Develop a web-based user interface (a web page) that allows users to easily search, explore, and obtain useful information from the FACES repository.

## Goals

* Modify the format of the existing FACES repository data to improve discovery, validation, and reduce updating errors
* Develop a web page that provides an intuitive, useful, and reliable user interface for searching and deriving information from the FACES repository

## Steps

1. Prepare a master list of all FACES county resources stored in a Google Sheet
1. Reformat the structure of the data to improve universal categorization of variables across the data fields (e.g., yes/no columns of services)
1. Create GitHub organization for FACES group and organization repository to host the web page
1. Develop codebase to ingest data from the master list
1. Develop codebase to format data for easy exploration and discovery via a web-based user interface
1. Conduct user testing of interface and redesign interface based on feedback
1. Host final webpage on GitHub pages and link from existing FACES website

## Out of Scope

* Hosting support outside of GitHub pages
* Validation of data integrity or updating data
